# 🧠 Roadmap

## 🚀 Lean Startup Roadmap for my AI Drug Repurposing Company

### Phase 1 – Foundation & Exploration (0–6 months)

#### ✅ Goal: Learn the landscape + build a tiny prototype

1. Research the space
   - Study existing players (BenevolentAI, Recursion Pharma, Healx).
   - Follow journals: _Nature Medicine, Lancet Digital Health, Journal of Cheminformatics_.
   - Identify “low-hanging fruit” — drugs with wide effects (aspirin, metformin, statins).
2. Learn the tools (at a “hacker” level)
   - Data: PubMed APIs, DrugBank, ClinicalTrials.gov, ChEMBL.
   - Coding: Python with libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, transformers, rdkit.
   - AI models: Start with simple NLP pipelines (e.g., extract all mentions of “drug X treats Y”).
3. Build a mini demo - Example: A script that scans PubMed abstracts for co-occurrences of drugs and diseases. - Output: A list of “candidate repurposing pairs.” - This is my proof of concept (PoC).

### Phase 2 – Prototyping & Networking (6–12 months)

#### ✅ Goal: Create something I can show potential partners

1. Prototype platform
   - Build a web app (basic dashboard) that:
     - Inputs a disease (e.g., “colon cancer”).
     - Outputs ranked existing drugs with supporting references.
2. Engage collaborators
   - Reach out to grad students, bioinformatics labs, or even open science groups.
   - Join communities: AI for Good, OpenBioML, Kaggle biomedical challenges.
3. Early validation
   - Run my prototype on a few known repurposing cases (aspirin/colon cancer, metformin/aging).
   - If it rediscovers known links → confidence goes up. 🔥 Woohoo!!!!!

### Phase 3 – Structuring the Startup (12–24 months)

#### ✅ Goal: Form a company + explore funding

1. Define business model
   - B2B SaaS: License AI to pharma/biotech.
   - Research partner: Joint discoveries with labs/universities.
   - Pipeline startup: Identify 1–2 high-potential repurposing candidates → move into preclinical research.
2. Build a founding team
   - Me (future MD + medical insight).
   - 1 data scientist / ML engineer.
   - 1 business-minded partner (fundraising, partnerships).
3. Funding opportunities
   - NIH SBIR/STTR grants for AI + healthcare.
   - Angel investors / accelerators (Y Combinator, IndieBio).
   - Strategic partnerships with universities.

### Phase 4 – Long-term Growth (2–5 years)

#### ✅ Goal: Transition from prototype → impactful platform

1. Regulatory alignment
   - FDA’s SaMD (software as a medical device) framework.
   - HIPAA compliance if integrating patient data.
2. Clinical validation
   - Partner with hospitals to test AI-generated repurposing ideas.
   - Small pilot studies → peer-reviewed publications.
3. Expansion
   - Extend into personalized medicine (drug matching for individuals using genomics).
   - Grow into global partnerships.
