Always consult qualified healthcare professionals for medical decisions. Any drug repurposing requires proper clinical trials and regulatory approval.

## What is Drug Repurposing?

**Drug repurposing** (also called drug repositioning) is the process of finding new therapeutic uses for existing, approved drugs. Instead of developing new drugs from scratch—which takes 10-15 years and costs billions—we identify existing drugs that could treat different diseases.

## Why is Drug Repurposing Important?

- **Faster to Market**: Existing drugs have known safety profiles
- **Lower Cost**: Reduces development time and expenses
- **Lower Risk**: Safety data already exists from previous trials
- **Patient Access**: Treatments reach patients years sooner

## How Does UpShiftRx Work?

We use advanced AI to analyze millions of research papers, clinical trials, and medical databases to identify potential drug-disease connections that human researchers might miss. Our algorithms can process decades of medical literature in minutes.

## What Makes UpShiftRx Different?

- **AI-Powered**: Automated literature mining at unprecedented scale
- **Evidence-Based**: Every suggestion backed by peer-reviewed research
