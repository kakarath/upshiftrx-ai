## 🌟 Mission

UpShiftRx is building AI-driven tools to discover **new uses for existing drugs**.  
Our goal is to accelerate healthcare innovation by mining medical literature, clinical trial data, and drug databases to uncover **repurposing opportunities** that can improve patient outcomes.

---

## 📖 Project Overview

This repository is the **R&D workspace** for our core AI platform.  
It contains:

- Scripts + pipelines for ingesting biomedical data (PubMed, DrugBank, ClinicalTrials.gov).
- Machine learning experiments for drug-disease relationship prediction.
- Jupyter notebooks documenting early proof-of-concepts.
- Results, visualizations, and supporting documentation.

---

## 🔬 First Prototype

- **Input**: A disease (e.g., _colon cancer_)
- **Output**: Candidate drugs with supporting references (e.g., _aspirin_ → known studies + confidence ranking).

Our first goal is a simple **literature-mining pipeline** to rediscover known drug repurposing cases.  
If the system can re-find what humans already know, it’s a strong signal we’re on the right track.

## ⚡ Quickstart

Get up and running in minutes.

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/upshiftrx-ai.git
   cd upshiftrx-ai
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Try a minimal example dataset
   - We include a few small CSVs under `results/examples/` so you can test the pipeline without hitting PubMed.
   ```bash
   python src/graph_results.py --input results/examples/sample_results.csv
   ```
   --> Opens an interactive graph in
   `results/drug_disease_graph.html`
5. Run a live query against PubMed

   ```bash
   # Single drug-disease pair
   python src/build_map.py --drug "aspirin" --disease "colon cancer"

   # Or run batch processing with config files
   python src/build_map.py

   # Generate interactive graph
   python src/graph_results.py
   ```

   --> Fetches PubMed papers, saves results under `results/`, and builds a knowledge graph.

## ⚡ Public Demo vs Full Datasets

This repository contains the **public prototype** of UpShiftRx AI:

- All scripts needed to run the **PubMed mining pipeline**.
- A **minimal example dataset** (`results/examples/sample_results.csv`) so you can try the visualization out-of-the-box.
- Documentation and roadmap to understand our vision.

**Full datasets and advanced pipelines** are **kept private** for compliance and IP protection.  
If you are a collaborator, partner, or interested researcher, you can request access via `info@upshiftrx.ai`.

This way contributors and testers have **two clear paths**:

- ✅ Play instantly with the **sample dataset** (fast, offline, no API calls).
- 🔥 Run the **live PubMed query** when they’re ready.

---

## 📊 Data & Results

This repo generates CSVs and graphs of drug–disease links from PubMed.

- **Small sample files** are included under `results/examples/` for quick testing.
- **Large datasets** (thousands of PubMed results) are **not stored in GitHub** to keep the repo lightweight.
- To regenerate them:

  ```bash
  # Single query
  python src/build_map.py --drug "aspirin" --disease "colon cancer"

  # Batch processing (uses config/drugs.json and config/diseases.json)
  python src/build_map.py

  # Custom rate limiting for large batches
  python src/build_map.py --sleep 3.0 --max-results 25
  ```

---

## 🛠️ Advanced Usage

**Command Line Options:**

```bash
# Single drug-disease pair
python src/build_map.py --drug "metformin" --disease "alzheimer's"

# Batch processing with custom settings
python src/build_map.py --max-results 100 --sleep 2.5

# Use custom config files
python src/build_map.py --drugs-config my_drugs.json --diseases-config my_diseases.json
```

**Configuration Files:**

- Edit `config/drugs.json` and `config/diseases.json` to customize your search lists
- Smaller lists = faster testing, larger lists = comprehensive analysis
