# UpShiftRx 🚀  
*AI-Powered Drug Repurposing for Better, Faster, Smarter Treatments*

---

## 🌟 Mission
UpShiftRx is building AI-driven tools to discover **new uses for existing drugs**.  
Our goal is to accelerate healthcare innovation by mining medical literature, clinical trial data, and drug databases to uncover **repurposing opportunities** that can improve patient outcomes.

## 📖 Project Overview
This repository is the **R&D workspace** for our core AI platform.  
It contains:
- Scripts + pipelines for ingesting biomedical data (PubMed, DrugBank, ClinicalTrials.gov).  
- Machine learning experiments for drug-disease relationship prediction.  
- Jupyter notebooks documenting early proof-of-concepts.  
- Results, visualizations, and supporting documentation.  

---

## 🔬 First Prototype
- **Input**: A disease (e.g., *colon cancer*)  
- **Output**: Candidate drugs with supporting references (e.g., *aspirin* → known studies + confidence ranking).  

Our first goal is a simple **literature-mining pipeline** to rediscover known drug repurposing cases.  
If the system can re-find what humans already know, it’s a strong signal we’re on the right track.
