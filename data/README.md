# Data Directory

This directory contains scripts and instructions for data fetching, but **not the actual large datasets**.

## What's Here:
- Data fetching scripts
- Data preprocessing utilities  
- Instructions for accessing external APIs (PubMed, DrugBank, etc.)

## What's NOT Here:
- Full PubMed datasets (thousands of papers)
- Complete DrugBank downloads
- Large CSV files (>1MB)

## Getting Full Datasets:
For access to complete datasets and proprietary data processing pipelines, contact `info@upshiftrx.ai` for collaborator access to our private repository.

## Sample Data:
Small example datasets are available in `results/examples/` for testing the pipeline without API calls.
